# This is a weather dashboard that pulls from OneWeather API.  You can input what city you want to search for and it will provide options.  Clicking on one will give you current weather and some information in the coming 5 days.  There is a history section that you can click on that stores up to 10 entries (hidden on mobile).  The API key is a dummy here.
